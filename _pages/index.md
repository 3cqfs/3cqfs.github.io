The **Tricontinental Quantum Fundamentals Seminar (3C-QFS)** series is a fortnightly meeting online, which aims to connect researchers from Australia, Europe and America. Our goal is to facilitate discussion between the three continents and bring together those working on foundational topics in relativistic quantum physics, covering but not limited to:

- Measurement and localisation in relativistic quantum field theory

- Holography, AdS/CFT, and analogue gravity

- Energy conditions and quantum inequalities

- Non-locality and observer-dependence of entanglement

- Quantum reference frames and symmetries in quantum theory

- Bandlimited quantum field theory, discrete spacetime, and generalised uncertainty relations

The seminars will be held online by Zoom, with talks from 40-60 minutes in length followed by an additional hour for further questions and discussion. We wish to promote open discussion and an inclusive community, encouraging a casual atmosphere in the sharing of opinions during the seminars. We will meet every two weeks, rotating among three times that have been chosen to connect research communities between two of the three continents.

Times have been scheduled for:

- Australia-Europe on <span id="utcTime1" data-datetime="2023-11-21T07:00:00Z"></span> <!-- Currently at 8:00 AM Stockholm time. Next year, we will push this time back to 10:00 AM. -->

- Europe-America on <span id="utcTime2" data-datetime="2023-11-23T14:00:00Z"></span>

- America-Australia on <span id="utcTime3" data-datetime="2023-11-23T23:00:00Z"></span>

For those unable to join the seminar live, the talks will be recorded and hosted on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3cqfs" target="_blank">3C-QFS YouTube channel</a>.

To join the seminars and participate in the discussions, we request that you sign up to the mailing list to receive notifications and meeting-links for the scheduled talks. <!-- TODO: We should create and link to a mailing list here. We may also wish to get a seminar specific email rather than direct people to contact us directly. -->
For talk proposals or general enquiries, please contact one of the organisers listed below.

#### Organisers <!-- TODO: We should ideally have another organiser based in America. We should also have the organisers act as a convener, introducing the speaker before the talk. -->

- **Nicholas Funai** (RMIT University)

- **Evan Gale** (The University of Queensland)

- **Germain Tobar** (Stockholm University)
