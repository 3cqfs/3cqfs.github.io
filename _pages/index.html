The <b>Tricontinental Quantum Fundamentals Seminar (3C-QFS)</b> series is a fortnightly meeting online, which aims to connect researchers from Australia, Europe and America.

Our goal is to facilitate discussion between the three continents and bring together those working on foundational topics in relativistic quantum physics, covering but not limited to:
<ul>
    <li>Measurement and localisation in relativistic quantum field theory</li>
    <li>Holography, AdS/CFT, and analogue gravity</li>
    <li>Energy conditions and quantum inequalities</li>
    <li>Non-locality and observer-dependence of entanglement</li>
    <li>Quantum reference frames and symmetries in quantum theory</li>
    <li>Bandlimited quantum field theory, discrete spacetime, and generalised uncertainty relations</li>
</ul>

<p>For 3C-QFS, we wish to foster an inclusive community and promote open discussion, encouraging a casual atmosphere in the sharing of opinions during the seminars.</p>

    <h2>Upcoming Seminars</h2>

    <p>The seminars will be held online via zoom, consisting of a 40-60 minute talk followed by additional time for further questions and discussion.
        
        We will meet every two weeks, rotating among three times that have been chosen to connect research communities between two of the three continents.
    
        See below for a list of upcoming seminars:</p>
